Eclipse Client is a cheat-free utility client for the Luanti game engine. It includes quality of life features, and other gameplay improvements.
It is a fork of Luanti, and the successor to MineBoostV2 by the Team Acedia dev team.

This client is not intended to be used for server hosting, while it will work, you will have better support with the parent project Luanti.

Paths
-----
Locations:

* `bin`   - Compiled binaries
* `share` - Distributed read-only data
* `user`  - User-created modifiable data

Where each location is on each platform:

* Windows .zip / RUN_IN_PLACE source:
    * `bin`   = `bin`
    * `share` = `.`
    * `user`  = `.`
* Windows installed:
    * `bin`   = `C:\Program Files\Minetest\bin (Depends on the install location)`
    * `share` = `C:\Program Files\Minetest (Depends on the install location)`
    * `user`  = `%APPDATA%\Minetest` or `%MINETEST_USER_PATH%`
* Linux installed:
    * `bin`   = `/usr/bin`
    * `share` = `/usr/share/minetest`
    * `user`  = `~/.minetest` or `$MINETEST_USER_PATH`
* macOS:
    * `bin`   = `Contents/MacOS`
    * `share` = `Contents/Resources`
    * `user`  = `Contents/User` or `~/Library/Application Support/minetest` or `$MINETEST_USER_PATH`

Worlds can be found as separate folders in: `user/worlds/`

Configuration file
------------------
- Default location:
    `user/minetest.conf`
- This file is created by closing Luanti for the first time.
- A specific file can be specified on the command line:
    `--config <path-to-file>`
- A run-in-place build will look for the configuration file in
    `location_of_exe/../minetest.conf` and also `location_of_exe/../../minetest.conf`

Command-line options
--------------------
- Use `--help`

Compiling
---------

- [Compiling - common information](doc/compiling/README.md)
- [Compiling on GNU/Linux](doc/compiling/linux.md)
- [Compiling on Windows](doc/compiling/windows.md)
- [Compiling on MacOS](doc/compiling/macos.md)

Version scheme
--------------
We use `major.minor-parent_major.parent_minor.parent_patch`.

- Major is incremented when the release contains major changes, Minor is then set to 0.
- Minor is incremented when the release contains minor features,

- Parent_Major is set to whatever the Major is on the parent project Luanti.
- Parent_Minor is set to whatever the Minor is on the parent project Luanti.
- Parent_Patch is set to whatever the Patch is on the parent project Luanti.
